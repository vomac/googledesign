                            <p class="color_65">When it comes to tech, truth is, fair isn’t the default. But there are
                                steps
                                we can take
                                collectively to make technology work better for everyone. Last weekend marked the 30th
                                anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and to celebrate that landmark
                                moment, I've gathered resources to propel us to design for all, not just right now, but
                                every day. There are over 1 billion<br> individuals living with a form of disability (be

                                visual, hearing, motor, cognitive, or situational). Accessing the web via individualized
                                keyboards, adaptive hardware, or alternative cues, this population isn’t always
                                represented
                                in our systems. Remote work presents even more possibilities for exclusion. As UXers,
                                we’re
                                in a position to make the platforms and products we work on more accessible. Browse
